# Step by step AdonisJS crash course
## by Marius Espejo

1. npm init adonis-ts-app@latest name-of-project
(for a TypeScript language following the framework adonis)

2. Type of:
web for a front + back-end project
api to a bacj-end aplication 
slim the most basic one

3. Enter name and eslint and prettier

4. npm run dev
or
cd name-of-project
node ace serve --watch

5. at this start moment you should play with routes on de file inside the start folder
make sure to use inside the async function ({ params, request, response, query })
get the request.body()
inform a response.status()
and return 'something' so you can check everything out


# Routes created for test

*http://localhost:3333*

## GET '/'

response:
{
  "hello": "world"
}

## POST '/post'

response:
{
  "message": "Hello I am the first route created by Duda's hands on this project"
}

## GET '/get/:id'

request: 
http://localhost:3333/get/*25*

response:
The id informated on params is 25

## PATCH '/context'

request:
  "name": "Duda",
  "message": "It's a plesure to meet you"
}

response:
It's a plesure to meet you

6. now its time to organize your controllers
node ace make:controller Pet
on this file you should provide some metodos so you can call on the routes file between string 'SomethingsController.index'

## GET '/pets' = index()

response:
list of pets

## POST '/pets/new' = store()

request:
{
  "name": "Bobby",
  "especie": "Cat",
  "description": "It has a cold heart but it's beautiful",
  "family": "2 sons"
}

response:
{
  "whatWasAdded": {
    "name": "Bobby",
    "especie": "Cat",
    "description": "It has a cold heart but it's beautiful",
    "family": "2 sons"
  },
  "message": "You added sucessfully a pet"
}

7. node ace list:routes
show you all the routes that you created until now 

8. to make crud more flexible 
Route.resource('/cars', 'CarsController') + node ace list:routes
you will be able to get all the possible routes on your terminal
apiOnly() at the end is ideal if its just a back-end application

## GET '/animals' = index()

response:
Should list all the content related to the class

## GET '/animals/create'

**just example, this is for web format**

## POST '/animals' = store()

request: 
{
  "name": "Lion"
}

response:
{
  "message": "We gonna add the content of body on the database",
  "newAnimal": {
    "name": "Lion"
  }
}

## GET '/animals/:id' = show()

response:
Display only the animal number 1

## GET '/animals/:id/edit' = edit()

**just example, this is for web format**

## PUT | PATCH '/animals/:id' = update()

request: 
{
  "name": "tiger"
}

response:
{
  "message": "We going to edit the animal that already exists at database based on the id informed",
  "dataToUpdated": {
    "name": "tiger"
  },
  "animalThatWillBeUpdated": "2"
}

## DELETE '/animals/:id' = destroy()

response:
The idea is to delete / destroy the number 2 on the list


*Now it's time to make thing feel more real*

9. Add and Config database 
npm install @adonisjs/lucid
node ace
